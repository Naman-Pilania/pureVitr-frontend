  <p class="text-sm">Chia seeds are tiny black seeds from the plant Salvia hispanica, which is related to mint. They are native to Central and South America and have been consumed for centuries due to their nutritional benefits. Chia seeds are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, protein, antioxidants, and various micronutrients such as calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus. They can absorb liquid and form a gel-like consistency, making them a popular addition to smoothies, yogurt, oatmeal, and baked goods. Chia seeds are also known for their potential health benefits, including improved digestion, heart health, and weight management.</p>
